# Smart-City Operations Research

The economic and social fabric of the high-density clusters in city-centred metropolitan areas is elaborately interwoven, with the well-being of each citizen intricately enmeshed with the activities of others.Servicing different areas of human needs requires highly structured transportation and communication networks throughout the city for effective provision of a variety of urban services.

### Why urban operations need to be improved? 
Citizens are demanding more urban services, by type, quantity, and quality. Yet, most cities lack the ability to pay for additional services. The resulting pressure, between the demands for more and better services, and on the other hand, decreased costs, has created a strong need for improved management decision making in urban services.  

 

### History of Urban Operations Research 
<ul>
  <li>In 1736, the famous mathematician Leonhard Euler was confronted with an urban deployment problem when he attempted to find a feasible parade route over the seven bridges of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) such that no bridge was crossed more than once. Euler founded as a by-product, the extremely useful field of graph or network theory.

    In 1937, Merrill Flood of Columbia University is credited as having serious interest in the “traveling salesman problem” through his efforts to route school buses more efficiently.

### Uncertainties in Smart City and Need for a Probabilistic Analysis  

Most urban services face uncertainties related to time of occurrence, type, location, and quantity of demands. Consider an individual household, for instance, the amount of refuse it generates, the amount of mail it sends and receives, its need for emergency assistance (from police, fire, ambulance, or emergency repair service), and its use of public and private transit facilities fluctuate from day to day.  

Not all interactions between the residents and the urban services can be predictable. There are regular statistical patterns that allow us to predict reliably the percentage of transit rides that will use a system between a certain time frame or the fraction of a city’s refuse that will be generated from a particular neighborhood over the course of a year. But the exact time and location of any particular demand for service, unlike scheduled arrivals at a doctor’s office, cannot be predicted. Such uncertainties can cause system congestion even when on the average, there is sufficient system capacity to handle demands. 

Deterministic reasoning, common in present planning procedures, argues that the system is not congested since it is busy on ambulance runs for only 4 hours out of 8 hours. Probabilistic reasoning may argue that generation of emergency calls in a city can be accurately modeled by Poisson process. Given the Poisson assumptions, the number of ambulance calls that occur during any particular 8-hour tour is a random variable with the Poisson probability mass function.
