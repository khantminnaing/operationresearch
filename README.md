# Smart-City Operations Research

The economic and social fabric of the high-density clusters in city-centred metropolitan areas is elaborately interwoven, with the well-being of each citizen intricately enmeshed with the activities of others.Servicing different areas of human needs requires highly structured transportation and communication networks throughout the city for effective provision of a variety of urban services.

### Why urban operations need to be improved? 
Citizens are demanding more urban services, by type, quantity, and quality. Yet, most cities lack the ability to pay for additional services. The resulting pressure, between the demands for more and better services, and on the other hand, decreased costs, has created a strong need for improved management decision making in urban services.  

 

### History of Urban Operations Research 
<ul>
  <li>In 1736, the famous mathematician Leonhard Euler was confronted with an urban deployment problem when he attempted to find a feasible parade route over the seven bridges of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) such that no bridge was crossed more than once. Euler founded as a by-product, the extremely useful field of graph or network theory.

    In 1937, Merrill Flood of Columbia University is credited as having serious interest in the “traveling salesman problem” through his efforts to route school buses more efficiently.
